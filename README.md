# Capsule50 - Capsule of CS50's course learning outcomes.
Capsule50 is an Android app built with Kivy that encapsulates the core learnings from CS50 into an interactive, hands‑on experience. Designed as both a technical demonstration and a creative showcase, it brings algorithms and image processing concepts to life in a way that’s engaging and visually intuitive.

# Sorting Visualizations
Capsule50 features dynamic, animated visualizations of classic sorting algorithms — Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. Each algorithm is represented with interactive bars that change color and position to highlight comparisons, swaps, and insertions. This makes abstract algorithmic steps tangible, helping learners see exactly how data is ordered step by step.

# Image Filters
The app also integrates image filter effects implemented with Pillow and RGBA support. Users can apply transformations such as grayscale, sepia, blur, reflection, and edge detection to images, watching them update in real time. These filters demonstrate practical applications of pixel manipulation and reinforce concepts of computational thinking from CS50.

`This description is AI generated but the core idea is pure and all the efforts made are real.
Except the (sorting visualization setup) the alogrithmns and all other parts of the app are made without any AI intervention.`
